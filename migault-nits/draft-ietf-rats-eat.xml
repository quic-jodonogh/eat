      <t>An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides an attested claims set
that describes state and characteristics of an entity,
a device like a smartphone, IoT device, network equipment or such.
This claims set is used by a relying party, server or service to determine the type and degree of trust placed in the entity.</t>
      <t>An EAT is either a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or JSON Web Token (JWT) with attestation-oriented
claims.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) is a message made up of claims about an entity.
An entity may be a device, some hardware or some software.
The claims are ultimately used by a relying party who decides if and how it will interact with the entity.
The relying party may choose to trust, not trust or partially trust the entity.
For example, partial trust may be allowing a monetary transaction only up to a limit.</t>
      <t>The security model and goal for attestation are unique and are not the same as for other security standards like those for server authentication, user authentication and secured messaging.
To give an example of one aspect of the difference, consider the association and life-cycle of key material.
For authentication, keys are associated with a user or service and set up by actions performed by a user or an operator of a service.
For attestation, the keys are associated with specific devices and are configured by device manufacturers.
The reader is assumed to be familiar with the goals and security model for attestation as described in <xref target="RATS.Architecture"/> and are not repeated here.</t>
      <t>This document defines some common claims that are potentially of broad use.
EAT additionally allows proprietary claims and for further claims to be standardized.
Here are some examples:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Make and model of manufactured consumer device</li>
        <li>Make and model of a chip or processor, particularly for a security-oriented chip</li>
        <li>Identification and measurement of the software running on a device</li>
        <li>Configuration and state of a device</li>
        <li>Environmental characteristics of a device like its GPS location</li>
        <li>Formal certifications received</li>
      </ul>
      <t>EAT is constructed to support a wide range of use cases.</t>
      <t>No single set of claims can accommodate all use cases so EAT is constructed as a framework for defining specific attestation tokens for specific use cases.
In particular, EAT provides a profile mechanism to be able to clearly specify the claims needed, the cryptographic algorithms that should be used, and other characteristics for a particular token and use case.
<xref target="profiles"/> describes profile contents and provides a profile that is suitable for constrained device use cases.</t>
      <t>The entity's EAT implementation generates the claims and typically signs them with an attestation key.
It is responsible for protecting the attestation key.
Some EAT implementations will use components with very high resistance to attack like TPMs or secure elements.
Others may rely solely on simple software defenses.</t>
      <t>Nesting of tokens and claims sets is accommodated for composite devices that have multiple subsystems.</t>
      <t>An EAT may be encoded in either JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> or CBOR <xref target="RFC8949"/> as needed for each use case.
EAT is built on CBOR Web Token (CWT) <xref target="RFC8392"/> and JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> and inherits all their characteristics and their security mechanisms.
Like CWT and JWT, EAT does not imply any message flow.</t>
      <section anchor="entity-overview">
        <name>Entity Overview</name>
        <t>This document uses the term "entity" to refer to the target of an EAT.
Most of the claims defined in this document are claims about an entity.
An entity is equivalent to a target environment in an attester as defined in <xref target="RATS.Architecture"/>.</t>
        <t>Layered attestation and composite devices, as described in <xref target="RATS.Architecture"/>, are supported by a submodule mechanism (see <xref target="submods"/>).
Submodules allow nesting of EATs and of claims-sets so that such hierarchies can be modeled.</t>
        <t>An entity is the same as a "system component", as defined in the Internet Security Glossary <xref target="RFC4949"/>.</t>
        <t>Note that <xref target="RFC4949"/> defines  "entity" and "system entity" as synonyms, and that they may be a person or organization in addition to being a system component.
In the EAT context, "entity" never refers to a person or organization.
The hardware and software that implement a web site server or service may be an entity in the EAT sense, but the organization that operates, maintains or hosts the web site is not an entity.</t>
        <t>Some examples of entities:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A Secure Element</li>
          <li>A TEE</li>
          <li>A network card in a router</li>
          <li>A router, perhaps with each network card in the router a submodule</li>
          <li>An IoT device</li>
          <li>An individual process</li>
          <li>An app on a smartphone</li>
          <li>A smartphone with many submodules for its many subsystems</li>
          <li>A subsystem in a smartphone like the modem or the camera</li>
        </ul>
        <t>An entity may have strong security defenses against hardware invasive attacks.
It may also have low security, having no special security defenses.
There is no minimum security requirement to be an entity.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="eat-as-a-framework">
        <name>EAT as a Framework</name>
        <t>EAT is a framework for defining attestation tokens for specific use cases, not a specific token definition.
While EAT is based on and compatible with CWT and JWT, it can also be described as:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>An identification and type system for claims in claims-sets</li>
          <li>Definitions of common attestation-oriented claims</li>
          <li>Claims defined in CDDL and serialized using CBOR or JSON</li>
          <li>Security envelopes based on COSE and JOSE</li>
          <li>Nesting of claims sets and tokens to represent complex and compound devices</li>
          <li>A profile mechanism for specifying and identifying specific tokens for specific use cases</li>
        </ul>
        <t>EAT uses the name/value pairs the same as CWT and JWT to identify individual claims.
<xref target="theclaims"/> defines common attestation-oriented claims that are added to the CWT and JWT IANA registries.
As with CWT and JWT, no claims are mandatory and claims not recognized should be ignored.</t>
        <t>Unlike, but compatible with CWT and JWT, EAT defines claims using Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610"/>.
In most cases the same CDDL definition is used for both the CBOR/CWT serialization and the JSON/JWT serialization.</t>
        <t>Like CWT and JWT, EAT uses COSE and JOSE to provide authenticity, integrity and optionally confidentiality.
EAT places no new restrictions on cryptographic algorithms, retaining all the cryptographic flexibility of CWT, COSE, JWT and JOSE.</t>
        <t>EAT defines a means for nesting tokens and claims sets to accommodate composite devices that have multiple subsystems and multiple attesters.
Tokens with security envelopes or bare claims sets may be embedded in an enclosing token.
The nested token and the enclosing token do not have to use the same encoding (e.g., a CWT may be enclosed in a JWT).</t>
        <t>EAT adds the ability to detach claims sets and send them separately from a security-enveloped EAT that contains a digest of the detached claims set.</t>
        <t>This document registers no media or content types for the identification of the type of EAT, its serialization encoding or security envelope.
The definition and registration of EAT media types is addressed in <xref target="EAT.media-types"/>.</t>
        <t>Finally, the notion of an EAT profile is introduced that facilitates the creation of narrowed definitions of EATs for specific use cases in follow-on documents.
One basic profile for constrained devices is normatively defined.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="operating-model-and-rats-architecture">
        <name>Operating Model and RATS Architecture</name>
        <t>EAT follows the operational model described in Figure 1 in <xref target="RATS.Architecture"/>. To summarize, an attester generates evidence in the form of a claims set describing various characteristics of an entity.
Evidence is usually signed by a key that proves the attester and the evidence it produces are authentic.
The claims set includes a nonce or some other means to assure freshness.</t>
        <t>A verifier confirms an EAT is valid by verifying the signature and may vet some claims using reference values.
The verifier then produces attestation results, which may also be represented as an EAT.
The attestation results are provided to the relying party, which is the ultimate consumer of the Remote Attestation Procedure.
The relying party uses the attestation results as needed for its use case, perhaps allowing an entity to access a network, allowing a financial transaction or such.
In some cases, the verifier and relying party are not distinct entities.</t>
        <section anchor="relationship">
          <name>Relationship between Evidence and Attestation Results</name>
          <t>Any claim defined in this document or in the IANA CWT or JWT registry may be used in evidence or attestation results. The relationship of claims in attestation results to evidence is fundamentally governed by the verifier and the verifier's policy.</t>
          <t>A common use case is for the verifier and its policy to perform checks, calculations and processing with evidence as the input to produce a summary result in attestation results that indicates the overall health and status of the entity.
For example, measurements in evidence may be compared to reference values the results of which are represented as a simple pass/fail in attestation results.</t>
          <t>It is also possible that some claims in the Evidence will be forwarded unmodified to the relying party in attestation results.
This forwarding is subject to the verifier's implementation and policy.
The relying party should be aware of the verifier's policy to know what checks it has performed on claims it forwards.</t>
          <t>The verifier may modify claims it forwards, for example, to implement a privacy preservation functionality. It is also possible the verifier will put claims in the attestation results that give details about the entity that it has computed or looked up in a database.
For example, the verifier may be able to put an "oemid" claim in the attestation results by performing a look up based on a UEID (serial number) it received in evidence.</t>
          <t>This specification does not establish any normative rules for the verifier to follow, as these are a matter of local policy.
It is up to each relying party to understand the processing rules of each verifier to know how to interpret claims in attestation results.</t>

      <name>Top-Level Token Definition</name>
      <t>An "EAT" is an encoded (serialized) message the purpose of which is to transfer a Claims-Set between two parties.
An EAT <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always contain a Claims-Set.
In this document an EAT is always a CWT or JWT.</t>
      <t>An EAT <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have authenticity and integrity protection.
CWT and JWT provide that in this document.</t>
      <t>Further documents may define other encodings and security mechanims for EAT.</t>
      <t>The identification of a protocol element as an EAT follows the general conventions used for CWTs and JWTs.
Identification depends on the protocol carrying the EAT.
In some cases it may be by media type (e.g., in a HTTP Content-Type field).
In other cases it may be through use of CBOR tags.
There is no fixed mechanism across all use cases.</t>
      <t>This document also defines another message, the detached EAT bundle (see <xref target="DEB"/>), which holds a collection of detached claims sets and an EAT that provides integrity and authenticity protection for them.
Detached EAT bundles can be either CBOR or JSON encoded.</t>
      <t>The following CDDL defines the top-level <tt>$EAT-CBOR-Tagged-Token</tt>, <tt>$EAT-CBOR-Untagged-Token</tt> and <tt>$EAT-JSON-Token-Formats</tt> sockets (see <xref section="3.9" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8610"/>), enabling future token formats to be defined.
Any new format that plugs into one or more of these sockets <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be defined by an IETF standards action.
Of particular use may be a token type that provides no direct authenticity or integrity protection for use with transports mechanisms that do provide the necessary security services <xref target="UCCS"/>.</t>
      <t>Nesting of EATs is allowed and defined in <xref target="Nested-Token"/>.
This includes the nesting of an EAT that is a different format than the enclosing EAT, i.e., the nested EAT may be encoded using CBOR and the enclosing EAT encoded using JSON or vice versa.
The definition of Nested-Token references the CDDL defined in this section.
When new token formats are defined, the means for identification in a nested token <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be defined.</t>
      <t>The top-level CDDL type for CBOR-encoded EATs is EAT-CBOR-Token and for JSON is EAT-JSON-Token (while CDDL and CDDL tools provide enough support for shared definitions of most items in this document, they don't provide enough support for this sharing at the top level).</t>

      <name>The Claims</name>
      <t>This section describes new claims defined for attestation that are to be added to the CWT <xref target="IANA.CWT.Claims"/> and JWT <xref target="IANA.JWT.Claims"/> IANA registries.</t>
      <t>All definitions, requirements, creation and validation procedures, security considerations, IANA registrations and so on from CWT and JWT carry over to EAT.</t>
      <t>This section also describes how several extant CWT and JWT claims apply in EAT.</t>
      <t>The set of claims that an EAT must contain to be considered valid is context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.
Specific applications of EATs will require implementations to understand and process some claims in particular ways.
However, in the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood by implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored.</t>
      <t>CDDL, along with a text description, is used to define each claim
independent of encoding.  Each claim is defined as a CDDL group.
In <xref target="encoding"/> on encoding, the CDDL groups turn into CBOR map entries and JSON name/value pairs.</t>
      <t>Each claim defined in this document is added to the <tt>$$Claims-Set-Claims</tt> group socket. Claims defined by other specifications <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be added to the <tt>$$Claims-Set-Claims</tt> group socket.</t>
      <t>All claims in an EAT <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the same encoding except where otherwise explicitly stated (e.g., in a CBOR-encoded token, all claims must be CBOR-encoded).</t>
      <t>This specification includes a CDDL definition of most of what is defined in <xref target="RFC8392"/>.
Similarly, this specification includes CDDL for most of what is defined in <xref target="RFC7519"/>.
These definitions are in <xref target="CDDL_for_CWT"/> and are not normative.</t>
      <t>Each claim described has a unique text string and integer that identifies it.
CBOR-encoded tokens <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use only the integer for claim keys.
JSON-encoded tokens <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use only the text string for claim names.</t>
      <section anchor="nonce">
        <name>eat_nonce (EAT Nonce) Claim</name>
        <t>An EAT nonce is either a byte or text string or an array of byte or text strings.
The array option supports multistage EAT verification and consumption.</t>
        <t>A claim named "nonce" was defined and registered with IANA for JWT, but <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used because it does not support multiple nonces.
No previous "nonce" claim was defined for CWT.
To distinguish from the previously defined JWT "nonce" claim, this claim is named "eat_nonce" in JSON-encoded EATs. The CWT nonce defined
here is intended for general purpose use and retains the "Nonce" claim name instead of an EAT-specific name.</t>
        <t>An EAT nonce <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have at least 64 bits of entropy.
A maximum EAT nonce size is set to limit the memory required for an implementation.
All receivers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to accommodate the maximum size.</t>
        <t>In CBOR, an EAT nonce is a byte string.
The minimum size is 8 bytes.
The maximum size is 64 bytes.</t>
        <t>In JSON, an EAT nonce is a text string.
It is assumed that only characters represented by the lower 7 bits of each byte will be used, so the text string must be one-seventh longer because the 8th bit doesn't contribute to entropy.
The minimum size for JSON-encoded EATs is 10 bytes and the maximum size is 74 bytes.</t>

        <t>The claims in this section describe the entity itself.
They describe the entity whether they occur in evidence or occur in attestation results.

        <section anchor="UEID">
          <name>ueid (Universal Entity ID) Claim</name>
          <t>The "ueid" claim conveys a UEID, which identifies an individual manufactured entity like a
mobile phone, a water meter, a Bluetooth speaker or a networked
security camera. It may identify the entire entity or a submodule.
It does not identify types, models or classes of
entities. It is akin to a serial number, though it does not have to be
sequential.</t>
          <t>UEIDs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be universally and globally unique across manufacturers
and countries. UEIDs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be unique across protocols and systems,
as tokens are intended to be embedded in many different protocols and
systems. No two products anywhere, even in completely different
industries made by two different manufacturers in two different
countries should have the same UEID (if they are not global and
universal in this way, then relying parties receiving them will have
to track other characteristics of the entity to keep entities distinct
between manufacturers).</t>
          <t>UEIDs are not designed for direct use by humans (e.g., printing on
the case of a device), so no textual representation is defined.</t>
          <t>There are privacy considerations for UEIDs. See <xref target="ueidprivacyconsiderations"/>.</t>
          <t>A Device Identifier URN is registered for UEIDs. See <xref target="registerueidurn"/>.</t>

            <name>Rules for Creating UEIDs</name>
            <t>These rules are solely for the creation of UEIDs.
The consumer need not have any awareness of them.</t>
            <t>A UEID is constructed of a single type byte followed by the unique bytes for that type.
The type byte assures global uniqueness of a UEID even if the unique bytes for different types are accidentally the same.</t>
            <t>UEIDS are variable length to accommodate the types defined here and future-defined types.</t>
            <t>UEIDs <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be longer than 33 bytes.
If they are longer, there is no guarantee that a receiver will be able to accept them.
See <xref target="UEID-Design"/>.</t>
            <t>A UEID is permanent. It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> never change for a given entity.</t>
            <t>The different types of UEIDs 1) accommodate different manufacturing processes, 2) accommodate small UEIDs, 3) provide an option that doesn't require registration fees and central administration.</t>
            <t>In the unlikely event that a new UEID type is needed, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be defined in a standards-track update to this document.</t>
            <t>A manufacturer of entities <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use different types for different products.
They <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also change from one type to another for a given product or use one type for some items of a given produce and another type for other.</t>

            <name>Rules for Consuming UEIDs</name>
            <t>For the consumer, a UEID is solely a globally unique opaque identifier.
The consumer does not and should not have any awareness of the rules and structure used to achieve global uniqueness.</t>
            <t>All implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to receive UEIDs up to 33 bytes long.
33 bytes is the longest defined in this document and gives necessary entropy for probabilistic uniqueness.</t>
            <t>The consumer of a UEID <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat it as a completely opaque string of bytes and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> make any use of its internal structure.
The reasons for this are:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>UEIDs types vary freely from one manufacturer to the next.</li>
              <li>New types of UEIDs may be defined.</li>
              <li>The manufacturer of an entity is allowed to change from one type of UEID to another anytime they want.</li>
            </ul>
            <t>For example, when the consumer receives a type 0x02 UEID, they should not use the OUI part to identify the manufacturer of the device because there is no guarantee all UEIDs will be type 0x02.
Different manufacturers may use different types.
A manufacturer may make some of their product with one type and others with a different type or even change to a different type for newer versions of their product.
Instead, the consumer should use the "oemid" claim.</t>

          <name>sueids (Semi-permanent UEIDs) Claim (SUEIDs)</name>
          <t>The "sueids" claim conveys one or more semi-permanent UEIDs (SUEIDs). An SUEID has the same format, characteristics and requirements as a UEID, but <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> change to a different value on entity life-cycle events.
An entity <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> have both a UEID and SUEIDs, neither, one or the other.</t>
          <t>Examples of life-cycle events are change of ownership, factory reset and on-boarding into an IoT device management system.
It is beyond the scope of this document to specify particular types of SUEIDs and the life-cycle events that trigger their change.
An EAT profile <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide this specification.</t>
          <t>There <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be multiple SUEIDs.
Each has a text string label the purpose of which is to distinguish it from others.
The label <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> name the purpose, application or type of the SUEID.
For example, the label for the SUEID used by XYZ Onboarding Protocol could thus be "XYZ".
It is beyond the scope of this document to specify any SUEID labeling schemes.
They are use case specific and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be specified in an EAT profile.</t>

            <t>The IEEE operates a global registry for MAC addresses and company IDs.
This claim uses that database to identify OEMs. The contents of the
claim may be either an IEEE MA-L, MA-M, MA-S or an IEEE CID
<xref target="IEEE-RA"/>.  An MA-L, formerly known as an OUI, is a 24-bit value
used as the first half of a MAC address. MA-M similarly is a 28-bit
value uses as the first part of a MAC address, and MA-S, formerly
known as OUI-36, a 36-bit value.  Many companies already have purchased
one of these. A CID is also a 24-bit value from the same space as an
MA-L, but not for use as a MAC address.  IEEE has published Guidelines
for Use of EUI, OUI, and CID <xref target="OUI.Guide"/> and provides a lookup
service <xref target="OUI.Lookup"/>.</t>
            <t>Companies that have more than one of these IDs or MAC address blocks
<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> select one and prefer that for all their entities.</t>
            <t>Commonly, these are expressed in Hexadecimal Representation as described in
<xref target="IEEE.802-2001"/>. It is also called the Canonical format. When this claim is
encoded the order of bytes in the bstr are the same as the order in the
Hexadecimal Representation. For example, an MA-L like "AC-DE-48" would
be encoded in 3 bytes with values 0xAC, 0xDE, 0x48.</t>
            <t>This format is always 3 bytes in size in CBOR.</t>

          <name>dbgstat (Debug Status) Claim</name>
          <t>The "dbgstat" claim applies to entity-wide or submodule-wide debug facilities of the
entity like <xref target="JTAG"/> and diagnostic hardware built into
chips. It applies to any software debug facilities related to root,
operating system or privileged software that allow system-wide memory
inspection, tracing or modification of non-system software like user
mode applications.</t>
          <t>This characterization assumes that debug facilities can be enabled and
disabled in a dynamic way or be disabled in some permanent way, such
that no enabling is possible. An example of dynamic enabling is one
where some authentication is required to enable debugging. An example
of permanent disabling is blowing a hardware fuse in a chip. The specific
type of the mechanism is not taken into account. For example, it does
not matter if authentication is by a global password or by per-entity
public keys.</t>
          <t>As with all claims, the absence of the "dbgstat" claim means it is not reported.</t>
          <t>This claim is not extensible so as to provide a common interoperable description of debug status.
If a particular implementation considers this claim to be inadequate, it can define its own proprietary claim.
It may consider including both this claim as a coarse indication of debug status and its own proprietary claim as a refined indication.</t>
          <t>The higher levels of debug disabling requires that all debug disabling
of the levels below it be in effect. Since the lowest level requires
that all of the target's debug be currently disabled, all other levels
require that too.</t>
          <t>There is no inheritance of claims from a submodule to a superior
module or vice versa. There is no assumption, requirement or guarantee
that the target of a superior module encompasses the targets of
submodules. Thus, every submodule must explicitly describe its own
debug state. The receiver of an EAT <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
assume that debug is turned off in a submodule because there is a claim
indicating it is turned off in a superior module.</t>
          <t>An entity may have multiple debug
facilities. The use of plural in the description of the states
refers to that, not to any aggregation or inheritance.</t>
          <t>The architecture of some chips or devices may be such that a debug
facility operates for the whole chip or device. If the EAT for such
a chip includes submodules, then each submodule should independently
report the status of the whole-chip or whole-device debug facility.
This is the only way the receiver can know the debug status
of the submodules since there is no inheritance.</t>

Latitude, longitude, altitude, accuracy, altitude-accuracy, heading and speed <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be as defined in the W3C Geolocation API <xref target="W3C.GeoLoc"/>
(which, in turn, is based on <xref target="WGS84"/>).
If the entity is stationary, the heading is NaN (floating-point not-a-number).
Latitude and longitude <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always be provided.
If any other of these values are unknown, they are omitted.</t>
          <t>The location may have been cached for a period of time before token
creation. For example, it might have been minutes or hours or more
since the last contact with a GPS satellite. Either the timestamp or
age data item can be used to quantify the cached period.  The timestamp
data item is preferred as it a non-relative time.
If the entity has no clock or the clock is unset but has a means to measure the time interval between the acquisition of the location and the token creation the age may be reported instead.
The age is in seconds.</t>

        <section anchor="manifests">
          <name>manifests (Software Manifests) Claim</name>
          <t>The "manifests" claim contains descriptions of software present on the entity.
These manifests are installed on the entity when the software is installed or are created as part of the installation process.
Installation is anything that adds software to the entity, possibly factory installation, the user installing elective applications and so on.
The defining characteristic of a manifest is that it is created by the software manufacturer.
The purpose of this claim is to relay unmodified manifests to the verifier and possibly to the relying party.</t>
          <t>Some manifests are signed by their software manufacturer independently, and some are not either because they do not support signing or the manufacturer chose not to sign them.
For example, a CoSWID might be signed independently before it is included in an EAT.
When signed manifests are put into an EAT, the manufacturer's signature <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be included even though an EAT's signature will also cover the manifest.</t>
          <t>This claim allows multiple manifest formats.
For example, the manifest may be a CBOR-encoded CoSWID, an XML-encoded SWID or other.
Identification of the manifest format is by a CoAP Content-Format integer <xref target="RFC7252"/>.
If there is no CoAP identifier registered for a manifest format, one <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be registered.</t>
          <t>This claim <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be an array of one or more manifests.
Each manifest in the claim <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be an array of two.
The first item in the array of two <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be an integer CoAP Content-Format identifier.
The second item is <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the actual manifest.</t>
          <t>In JSON-encoded tokens the manifest, whatever encoding it is, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be placed in a text string.
When a non-text encoded manifest like a CBOR-encoded CoSWID is put in a JSON-encoded token, the manifest <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be base-64 encoded.</t>
          <t>This claim allows for multiple manifests in one token since multiple software packages are likely to be present.
The multiple manifests <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be of different encodings.
In some cases EAT submodules may be used instead of the array structure in this claim for multiple manifests.</t>
          <t>A CoSWID manifest <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a payload CoSWID, not an evidence CoSWID.
These are defined in <xref target="CoSWID"/>.</t>
          <t>A <xref target="SUIT.Manifest"/> may be used as a manifest.</t>
          <t>This claim is extensible for use of manifest formats beyond those mentioned in this document.
No particular manifest format is preferred.
For manifest interoperability, an EAT profile as defined in <xref target="profiles"/>, should be used to specify which manifest format(s) are allowed.</t>

          <name>measres (Software Measurement Results) Claim</name>
          <t>The "measres" claim is a general-purpose structure for reporting comparison of measurements to expected reference values.
This claim provides a simple standard way to report the result of a comparison as success, failure, fail to run, and absence.</t>
          <t>It is the nature of measurement systems that they are specific to the operating system, software and hardware of the entity that is being measured.
It is not possible to standardize what is measured and how it is measured across platforms, OS's, software and hardware.
The recipient must obtain the information about what was measured and what it indicates for the characterization of the security of the entity from the provider of the measurement system.
What this claim provides is a standard way to report basic success or failure of the measurement.
In some use cases it is valuable to know if measurements succeeded or failed in a general way even if the details of what was measured is not characterized.</t>
          <t>This claim <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be generated by the verifier and sent to the relying party.
For example, it could be the results of the verifier comparing the contents of the "measurements" claim, <xref target="measurements"/>, to reference values.</t>
          <t>This claim <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also be generated on the entity if the entity has the ability for one subsystem to measure and evaluate another subsystem.
For example, a TEE might have the ability to measure the software of the rich OS and may have the reference values for the rich OS.</t>
          <t>Within an entity, attestation target or submodule, multiple results can be reported.
For example, it may be desirable to report the results for measurements of the file system, chip configuration, installed software, running software and so on.</t>
          <t>Note that this claim is not for reporting the overall result of a verifier.
It is solely for reporting the result of comparison to reference values.</t>
          <t>An individual measurement result (individual-result) is an array consisting of two elements, an identifier of the measurement (result-id) and an enumerated type of the result (result).
Different measurement systems will measure different things and perhaps measure the same thing in different ways.
It is up to each measurement system to define identifiers (result-id) for the measurements it reports.</t>
          <t>Each individual measurement result is part of a group that may contain many individual results.
Each group has a text string that names it, typically the name of the measurement scheme or system.</t>
          <t>The claim itself consists of one or more groups.</t>
          <t>The values for the results enumerated type are as follows:</t>
          <dl>
            <dt>1 -- comparison successful:</dt>

        <section anchor="submods">
          <name>submods (Submodules)</name>
          <t>Some devices are complex and have many subsystems.  A mobile phone is a good example. It may have subsystems for communications (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular), low-power audio and video playback, multiple
security-oriented subsystems like a TEE and a Secure Element, and etc. The claims for a subsystem can be grouped together in a submodule.</t>
          <t>Submodules may be used in either evidence or attestation results.</t>
          <t>Because system architecture will vary greatly from use case to use case, there are no set requirements for what a submodule represents either in evidence or in attestation results.
Profiles, <xref target="profiles"/>, may wish to impose requirements.
An attester that outputs evidence with submodules should document the semantics it associates with particular submodules for the verifier.
Likewise, a verifier that outputs attestation results with submodules should document the semantics it associates with the submodules for the relying party.</t>
          <t>A submodule claim is a map that holds some number of submodules.
Each submodule is named by its label in the submodule claim map.
The value of each entry in a submodule may be a Claims-Set, nested token or Detached-Submodule-Digest.
This allows for the submodule to serve as its own attester or not and allows for claims
for each submodule to be represented directly or indirectly, i.e., detached.</t>
          <t>A submodule may include a submodule, allowing for arbitrary levels of nesting.
However, submodules do not inherit anything from the containing token and must explicitly include all claims.
Submodules may contain claims that are present in any surrounding token or submodule.
For example, the top-level of the token may have a UEID, a submodule may have a different UEID and a further subordinate submodule may also have a UEID.</t>
          <t>The following sub-sections define the three types for representing submodules:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>A submodule Claims-Set</li>
            <li>The digest of a detached Claims-Set</li>
            <li>A nested token, which can be any EAT</li>
          </ul>
          <t>The Submodule type definition and Nested-Token type definition vary with the type of encoding. The definitions for CBOR-encoded EATs are as follows:</t>
          <sourcecode type="CDDL"><![CDATA[

          <t>The Submodule and Nested-Token definitions for JSON-encoded EATs is as below. This difference in definitions vs. CBOR is necessary because JSON has no tag mechanism and no byte string type to help indicate the nested token is CBOR.</t>

]]></sourcecode>
          <t>Nested tokens can be one of three types as defined in this document or types standardized in follow-on documents (e.g., <xref target="UCCS"/>).
Nested tokens are the only mechanism by which JSON can be embedded in CBOR and vice versa.</t>
          <t>The addition of further types is accomplished by augmenting the $EAT-CBOR-Tagged-Token socket or the $JSON-Selector-Type and $JSON-Selector-Value sockets.</t>
          <t>When decoding a JSON-encoded EAT, the type of submodule is determined as follows.
A JSON object indicates the submodule is a Claims-Set.
In all other cases, it is a JSON-Selector, which is an array of two elements that indicates whether the submodule is a nested token or a Detached-Submodule-Digest.The first element in the array indicates the type present in the second element.
If the value is "JWT", "CBOR", "BUNDLE" or a future-standardized token types, e.g., <xref target="UCCS"/>, the submodule is a nested token of the indicated type, i.e., JWT-Message, CBOR-Token-Inside-JSON-Token, Detached-EAT-Bundle, or a future type.
If the value is "DIGEST", the submodule is a Detached-Submodule-Digest.
Any other value indicates a standardized extension to this specification.</t>
          <t>When decoding a CBOR-encoded EAT, the CBOR item type indicates the type of the submodule as follows.
A map indicates a CBOR-encoded submodule Claims-Set.
An array indicates a CBOR-encoded Detached-Submodule-Digest.
A byte string indicates a CBOR-encoded CBOR-Nested-Token.
A text string indicates a JSON-encoded JSON-Selector. Where JSON-Selector is used in a CBOR-encoded EAT, the "DIGEST" type and corresponding Detached-Submodule-Digest type <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used.</t>
          <t>The type of a CBOR-encoded nested token is always determined by the CBOR tag encountered after the byte string wrapping is removed in a CBOR-encoded enclosing token or after the base64 wrapping is removed in JSON-encoded enclosing token.</t>
          <t>The type of a JSON-encoded nested token is always determined by the string name in JSON-Selector and is always "JWT", "BUNDLE" or a new name standardized outside this document for a further type (e.g., "UCCS").
This string name may also be "CBOR" to indicate the nested token is CBOR-encoded.</t>

            <t>The Claims-Set type provides a means of representing claims from a submodule that does not have its own attesting environment,
i.e., it has no keys distinct from the attester producing the surrounding token. Claims are represented as a Claims-Set. Submodule claims represented in this way are secured by the same
mechanism as the enclosing token (e.g., it is signed by the same attestation key).</t>

The separately-conveyed Claims-Set is called a detached claims set.
The input to the digest algorithm is directly the CBOR or JSON-encoded Claims-Set for the submodule.
There is no byte-string wrapping or base 64 encoding.</t>
            <t>The data type for this type of submodule is an array consisting of two data items: an algorithm identifier and a byte string containing the digest.

The hash algorithm identifier is never from the JOSE Algorithm registry.</t>
            <t>A detached EAT bundle, described in <xref target="DEB"/>, may be used to convey detached claims sets and the EAT containing the corresponding detached digests.
EAT, however, doesn't require use of a detached EAT bundle.
Any other protocols may be used to convey detached claims sets and the EAT containing the corresponding detached digests.
Detached Claims-Sets must not be modified in transit, else validation will fail.</t>

            <t>The CBOR-Nested-Token and JSON-Selector types provide a means of representing claims from a submodule that has its own attesting environment,
i.e., it has keys distinct from the attester producing the surrounding token. Claims are represented in a signed EAT token.</t>
            <t>Inclusion of a signed EAT as a claim cryptographically binds the EAT to the surrounding token.
If it was conveyed in parallel with the surrounding token, there would be no such binding and attackers could substitute a good attestation from another device for the attestation of an errant subsystem.</t>
            <t>A nested token need not use the same encoding as the enclosing token.
This enables composite devices to be built without regards to the encoding used by components.
Thus, a CBOR-encoded EAT can have a JSON-encoded EAT as a nested token and vice versa.</t>

          <t>The "iat" claim defined in CWT and JWT is used to indicate the
date-of-creation of the token, the time at which the claims are
collected and the token is composed and signed.</t>
          <t>The data for some claims may be held or cached for some period of
time before the token is created. This period may be long, even
days. Examples are measurements taken at boot or a geographic
position fix taken the last time a satellite signal was received.
There are individual timestamps associated with these claims to
indicate their age is older than the "iat" timestamp.</t>
          <t>CWT allows the use of floating-point for this claim. EAT disallows
the use of floating-point. An EAT token <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain an "iat" claim in
floating-point format. Any recipient of a token with a floating-point

          <t>A 64-bit integer representation of the CBOR epoch-based time

          <t>The "eat_profile" claim identifies an EAT profile by either a URL or an OID.
Typically, the URI will reference a document describing the profile.
An OID is just a unique identifier for the profile.
It may exist anywhere in the OID tree.

The primary purpose of the "eat_profile" claim is to uniquely identify the profile even if it is a private profile.</t>

      <name>Detached EAT Bundles</name>
      <t>A detached EAT bundle is a message to convey an EAT plus detached claims sets secured by that EAT.
It is a top-level message like a CWT or JWT.
It can occur in any place that a CWT or JWT occurs, for example as a submodule nested token as defined in <xref target="Nested-Token"/>.</t>
      <t>A detached EAT bundle may be either CBOR or JSON-encoded.</t>
      <t>A detached EAT bundle consists of two parts.</t>
      <t>The first part is an encoded EAT as follows:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have at least one submodule that is a detached submodule digest as defined in <xref target="Detached-Submodule-Digest"/></li>
        <li>
          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be either CBOR or JSON-encoded and doesn't have to the the same as the encoding of the bundle</li>
        <li>
          <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be a CWT, or JWT or some future-defined token type, but <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be a detached EAT bundle</li>
        <li>
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be authenticity and integrity protected</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The same mechanism for distinguishing the type for nested token submodules is employed here.</t>
      <t>The second part is a map/object as follows:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a Claims-Set</li>
        <li>
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the same encoding as the bundle</li>
        <li>
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be wrapped in a byte string when the encoding is CBOR and be base64url-encoded when the encoding is JSON</li>
      </ul>
      <t>For CBOR-encoded detached EAT bundles, tag TBD602 can be used to identify it.
The standard rules apply for use or non-use of a tag.
When it is sent as a submodule, it is always sent as a tag to distinguish it from the other types of nested tokens.</t>
      <t>The digests of the detached claims sets are associated with detached Claims-Sets by label/name.
It is up to the constructor of the detached EAT bundle to ensure the names uniquely identify the detached claims sets.
Since the names are used only in the detached EAT bundle, they can be very short, perhaps one byte.</t>

      <t>EAT makes normative use of CBOR, JSON, COSE, JOSE, CWT and JWT.
Most of these have implementation options to accommodate a range of use cases.</t>
      <t>For example, COSE doesn't require a particular set of cryptographic algorithms so as to accommodate different usage scenarios and evolution of algorithms over time.
Section 10 of <xref target="RFC9052"/> describes the profiling considerations for COSE.</t>
      <t>The use of encryption is optional for both CWT and JWT.
Section 8 of <xref target="RFC7519"/> describes implementation requirement and recommendations for JWT.</t>
      <t>Similarly, CBOR provides indefinite length encoding, which is not commonly used, but valuable for very constrained devices.
For EAT itself, in a particular use case some claims will be used and others will not.
Section 4 of <xref target="RFC8949"/> describes serialization considerations for CBOR.</t>
      <t>For example a mobile phone use case may require the device make and model, and prohibit UEID and location for privacy reasons.
The general EAT standard retains all this flexibility because it too is aimed to accommodate a broad range of use cases.</t>
      <t>It is necessary to explicitly narrow these implementation options to guarantee interoperability.
EAT chooses one general and explicit mechanism, the profile, to indicate the choices made for these implementation options for all aspects of the token.</t>
      <t>Below is a list of the various issues that should be addressed by a profile.</t>
      <t>The "eat_profile" claim in <xref target="profile-claim"/> provides a unique identifier for the profile a particular token uses.</t>

          <t>A profile should specify what must be sent to identify the verification, decryption or MAC key or keys.
If multiple methods of key identification may be sent, a profile should require the receiver support them all.</t>
          <t><xref target="keyid"/> describes a number of methods for identifying verification keys.
When encryption is used, there are further considerations.
In some cases key identification may be very simple and in others involve multiple components.
For example, it may be simple through use of COSE key ID or it may be complex through use of an X.509 certificate hierarchy.</t>
          <t>While not always possible, a profile should specify or make reference to, a full end-end specification for key identification.
For example, a profile should specify in full detail how COSE key IDs are to be created, their lifecycle and such rather than just specifying that a COSE key ID be used.

      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>Certain EAT claims can be used to track the owner of an entity and
therefore, implementations should consider providing privacy-preserving
options dependent on the intended usage of the EAT.  Examples would
include suppression of location claims for EAT's provided to
unauthenticated consumers.</t>
      <section anchor="ueidprivacyconsiderations">
        <name>UEID and SUEID Privacy Considerations</name>
        <t>A UEID is usually not privacy-preserving. Relying parties
receiving tokens that happen to be from a particular entity will be
able to know the tokens are  from the same entity and be able to
identify the entity issuing those tokens.</t>
        <t>Thus the use of the claim may violate privacy policies. In other usage situations a UEID will
not be allowed for certain products like browsers that give privacy
for the end user. It will often be the case that tokens will not have
a UEID for these reasons.</t>
        <t>An SUEID is also usually not privacy-preserving.  In some cases it may
have fewer privacy issues than a UEID depending on when and how and
when it is generated.</t>
        <t>There are several strategies that can be used to still be able to put
UEIDs and SUEIDs in tokens:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The entity obtains explicit permission from the user of the entity
to use the UEID/SUEID. This may be through a prompt. It may also be through
a license agreement.  For example, agreements for some online banking
and brokerage services might already cover use of a UEID/SUEID.</li>
          <li>The UEID/SUEID is used only in a particular context or particular use
case. It is used only by one relying party.</li>
          <li>The entity authenticates the relying party and generates a derived
UEID/SUEID just for that particular relying party.  For example, the relying
party could prove their identity cryptographically to the entity, then
the entity generates a UEID just for that relying party by hashing a
proofed relying party ID with the main entity UEID/SUEID.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Note that some of these privacy preservation strategies result in
multiple UEIDs and SUEIDs per entity. Each UEID/SUEID is used in a
different context, use case or system on the entity. However, from the
view of the relying party, there is just one UEID and it is still
globally universal across manufacturers.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="locationprivacyconsiderations">
        <name>Location Privacy Considerations</name>
        <t>Geographic location is most always considered personally identifiable information.
Implementers should consider laws and regulations governing the transmission of location data from end user devices to servers and services.
Implementers should consider using location management facilities offered by the operating system on the entity generating the attestation.
For example, many mobile phones prompt the user for permission before sending location data.</t>

        <name>Boot Seed Privacy Considerations</name>

      <section anchor="replayprivacyconsiderations">
        <name>Replay Protection and Privacy</name>
        <t>EAT defines the EAT nonce claim for replay protection and token freshness.
The nonce claim is based on a value usually derived remotely (outside of the entity).
This claim might be used to extract and convey personally identifying information either inadvertently or by intention.
For instance, an implementor may choose a nonce equivalent to a username associated with the device (e.g., account login).
If the token is inspected by a 3rd-party then this information could be used to identify the source of the token or an account associated with the token.
To avoid the conveyance of privacy-related information in the nonce claim, it should be derived using a salt that originates from a true and reliable random number generator or any other source of randomness that would still meet the target system requirements for replay protection and token freshness.</t>

      <section anchor="claim-trustworthiness">
        <name>Claim Trustworthiness</name>
        <t>This specification defines semantics for each claim.
It does not require any particular level of security in the implementation of the claims or even the attester itself.
Such specification is far beyond the scope of this document which is about a message format not the security level of an implementation.</t>
        <t>The receiver of an EAT comes to know the trustworthiness of the claims in it by understanding the implementation made by the attester vendor and/or understanding the checks and processing performed by the verifier.</t>
        <t>For example, this document says that a UEID is permanent and that it must not change, but it doesn't say what degree of attack to change it must be defended.</t>
        <t>The degree of security will vary from use case to use case.
In some cases the receiver may only need to know something of the implementation such as that it was implemented in a TEE.
In other cases the receiver may require the attester be certified by a particular certification program.
Or perhaps the receiver is content with very little security.</t>

        <name>Key Provisioning</name>
        <t>Private key material can be used to sign and/or encrypt the EAT, or
can be used to derive the keys used for signing and/or encryption.  In
some instances, the manufacturer of the entity may create the key
material separately and provision the key material in the entity
itself.  The manufacturer of any entity that is capable of producing
an EAT should take care to ensure that any private key material be
suitably protected prior to provisioning the key material in the
entity itself.  This can require creation of key material in an
enclave (see <xref target="RFC4949"/> for definition of "enclave"), secure
transmission of the key material from the enclave to the entity using
an appropriate protocol, and persistence of the private key material

          <name>Transmission of Key Material</name>
          <t>Regarding transmission of key material from the enclave to the entity,
the key material may pass through one or more intermediaries.
Therefore some form of protection ("key wrapping") may be necessary.
The transmission itself may be performed electronically, but can also
be done by human courier.  In the latter case, there should be minimal
to no exposure of the key material to the human (e.g. encrypted
portable memory).  Moreover, the human should transport the key
material directly from the secure enclave where it was created to a
destination secure enclave where it can be provisioned.</t>

        <t>All EAT use <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide a freshness mechanism to prevent replay and related attacks.
The extensive discussions on freshness in <xref target="RATS.Architecture"/> including security considerations apply here.
The EAT nonce claim, in <xref target="nonce"/>, is one option to provide freshness.</t>

      <section anchor="multiple-eat-consumers">
        <name>Multiple EAT Consumers</name>
        <t>In many cases, more than one EAT consumer may be required to fully
verify the entity attestation.  Examples include individual consumers
for nested EATs, or consumers for individual claims with an EAT.  When
multiple consumers are required for verification of an EAT, it is
important to minimize information exposure to each consumer.  In
addition, the communication between multiple consumers should be
secure.</t>
        <t>For instance, consider the example of an encrypted and signed EAT with
multiple claims.  A consumer may receive the EAT (denoted as the
"receiving consumer"), decrypt its payload, verify its signature, but
then pass specific subsets of claims to other consumers for evaluation
("downstream consumers").  Since any COSE encryption will be removed
by the receiving consumer, the communication of claim subsets to any
downstream consumer <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> leverage an equivalent communication security protocol
(e.g. Transport Layer Security).</t>
        <t>However, assume the EAT of the previous example is hierarchical and
each claim subset for a downstream consumer is created in the form of
a nested EAT.  Then the nested EAT is itself encrypted and cryptographically verifiable (due to its
COSE envelope)
by a downstream consumer (unlike the previous example where a claims set
without a COSE envelope is sent to a downstream consumer).  Therefore, Transport Layer Security between the receiving and
downstream consumers is not strictly required.  Nevertheless,
downstream consumers of a nested EAT should provide a nonce unique to
the EAT they are consuming.</t>

      <section anchor="detached-eat-bundle-digest-security-considerations">
        <name>Detached EAT Bundle Digest Security Considerations</name>
        <t>A detached EAT bundle is composed of a nested EAT and
an claims set as per <xref target="DEB"/>.  Although the attached claims set is vulnerable to
modification in transit, any modification can be detected by the receiver through the associated
digest, which is a claim fully contained within an EAT.  Moreover, the digest itself can only be derived using
an appropriate COSE hash algorithm, implying that an attacker cannot induce false detection
of modified detached claims because the algorithms in the COSE registry are assumed to be
of sufficient cryptographic strength.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="verfication-key-sc">
        <name>Verification Keys</name>
        <t>In all cases there must be some way that the verification key is itself verified or determined to be trustworthy.
The key identification itself is never enough.
This will always be by some out-of-band mechanism that is not described here.
For example, the verifier may be configured with a root certificate or a master key by the verifier system administrator.</t>
        <t>Often an X.509 certificate or an endorsement carries more than just the verification key.
For example, an X.509 certificate might have key usage constraints, and an endorsement might have reference values.
When this is the case, the key identifier must be either a protected header or in the payload, such that it is cryptographically bound to the EAT.
This is in line with the requirements in section 6 on Key Identification in JSON Web Signature <xref target="RFC7515"/>.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.</t>
              <t>CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.</t>

One strategy, called the "single backslash" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line. The second strategy, called the "double backslash" strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy. Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content.</t>

              <t>   This specification describes the format of a manifest.  A manifest is
   a bundle of metadata about code/data obtained by a recipient (chiefly
   the firmware for an IoT device), where to find the that code/data,
   the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic information
   protecting the manifest.  Software updates and Trusted Invocation
   both tend to use sequences of common operations, so the manifest
   encodes those sequences of operations, rather than declaring the
   metadata.

            <abstract>
              <t>   This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates.  The
   resulting certificates are called C509 Certificates.  The CBOR
   encoding supports a large subset of RFC 5280 and all certificates
   compatible with the RFC 7925, IEEE 802.1AR (DevID), CNSA, RPKI, GSMA
   eUICC, and CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements profiles.  When
   used to re-encode DER encoded X.509 certificates, the CBOR encoding
   can in many cases reduce the size of RFC 7925 profiled certificates
   with over 50%.  The CBOR encoded structure can alternatively be
   signed directly ("natively signed"), which does not require re-
   encoding for the signature to be verified.  The document also
   specifies C509 COSE headers, a C509 TLS certificate type, and a C509
   file format.

        <name>Collision Probability</name>
        <t>This calculation is to determine the probability of a collision of
UEIDs given the total possible entity population and the number of
entities in a particular entity management database.</t>
        <t>Three different sized databases are considered. The number of devices
per person roughly models non-personal devices such as traffic lights,
devices in stores they shop in, facilities they work in and so on,
even considering individual light bulbs. A device may have
individually attested subsystems, for example parts of a car or a
mobile phone. It is assumed that the largest database will have at
most 10% of the world's population of devices. Note that databases
that handle more than a trillion records exist today.</t>
        <t>The trillion-record database size models an easy-to-imagine reality
over the next decades. The quadrillion-record database is roughly at
the limit of what is imaginable and should probably be accommodated.
The 100 quadrillion database is highly speculative perhaps involving
nanorobots for every person, livestock animal and domesticated
bird. It is included to round out the analysis.</t>
        <t>Note that the items counted here certainly do not have IP address and
are not individually connected to the network. They may be connected
to internal buses, via serial links, Bluetooth and so on.  This is
not the same problem as sizing IP addresses.</t>

operation of a database, it is assumed that the database size is in
a steady state and that 10% of the database changes per year. For example,
a trillion record database would have 100 billion states per year. Each
of those states has the above calculated probability of a collision.</t>
        <t>This assumption is a worst-case since it assumes that each

        <name>No Use of UUID</name>
        <t>A UEID is not a UUID <xref target="RFC4122"/> by conscious choice for the following
reasons.</t>
        <t>UUIDs are limited to 128 bits which may not be enough for some future
use cases.</t>
        <t>Today, cryptographic-quality random numbers are available from common
CPUs and hardware. This hardware was introduced between 2010 and 2015.
Operating systems and cryptographic libraries give access to this
hardware. Consequently, there is little need for implementations
to construct such random values from multiple sources on their own.</t>
        <t>Version 4 UUIDs do allow for use of such cryptographic-quality
random numbers, but do so by mapping into the overall UUID
structure of time and clock values. This structure is of no
value here yet adds complexity. It also slightly reduces the
number of actual bits with entropy.</t>
        <t>The design of UUID accommodates the construction of a unique identifier by combination of several identifiers that separately do not provide sufficient uniqueness.
UEID takes the view that this construction is no longer needed, in particular because cryptographic-quality random number generators are readily available.
It takes the view that hardware, software and/or manufacturing process implement UEID in a simple and direct way.</t>
        <t>Note also that that a type 2 UEID (EUI/MAC) is only 7 bytes compared to 16 for a UUID.</t>

    <section anchor="eat-relation-to-ieee8021ar-secure-device-identity-devid">
      <name>EAT Relation to IEEE.802.1AR Secure Device Identity (DevID)</name>
      <t>This section describes several distinct ways in which an IEEE IDevID <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR"/> relates to EAT, particularly to UEID and SUEID.</t>
      <t><xref target="IEEE.802.1AR"/> orients around the definition of an implementation called a "DevID Module."
It describes how IDevIDs and LDevIDs are stored, protected and accessed using a DevID Module.
A particular level of defense against attack that should be achieved to be a DevID is defined.
The intent is that IDevIDs and LDevIDs can be used with any network protocol or message format.
In these protocols and message formats the DevID secret is used to sign a nonce or similar to prove the association of the DevID certificates with the device.</t>
      <t>By contrast, EAT standardizes a message format that is sent to a relying party, the very thing that is not defined in <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR"/>.
Nor does EAT give details on how keys, data and such are stored protected and accessed.
EAT is intended to work with a variety of different on-device implementations ranging from minimal protection of assets to the highest levels of asset protection.
It does not define any particular level of defense against attack, instead providing a set of security considerations.</t>
      <t>EAT and DevID can be viewed as complimentary when used together or as competing to provide a device identity service.</t>
      <section anchor="devid-used-with-eat">
        <name>DevID Used With EAT</name>
        <t>As just described, EAT standardizes a message format and <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR"/> doesn't.
Vice versa, EAT doesn't define a an device implementation, but DevID does.</t>
        <t>Hence, EAT can be the message format that a DevID is used with.
The DevID secret becomes the attestation key used to sign EATs.
The DevID and its certificate chain become the endorsement sent to the verifier.</t>
        <t>In this case, the EAT and the DevID are likely to both provide a device identifier (e.g. a serial number).
In the EAT it is the UEID (or SUEID).
In the DevID (used as an endorsement), it is a device serial number included in the subject field of the DevID certificate.
It is probably a good idea in this use for them to be the same serial number or for the UEID to be a hash of the DevID serial number.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="how-eat-provides-an-equivalent-secure-device-identity">
        <name>How EAT Provides an Equivalent Secure Device Identity</name>
        <t>The UEID, SUEID and other claims like OEM ID are equivalent to the secure device identity put into the subject field of a DevID certificate.
These EAT claims can represent all the same fields and values that can be put in a DevID certificate subject.
EAT explicitly and carefully defines a variety of useful claims.</t>
        <t>EAT secures the conveyance of these claims by having them signed on the device by the attestation key when the EAT is generated.
EAT also signs the nonce that gives freshness at this time.
Since these claims are signed for every EAT generated, they can include things that vary over time like GPS location.</t>
        <t>DevID secures the device identity fields by having them signed by the manufacturer of the device sign them into a certificate.
That certificate is created once during the manufacturing of the device and never changes so the fields cannot change.</t>
        <t>So in one case the signing of the identity happens on the device and the other in a manufacturing facility,
but in both cases the signing of the nonce that proves the binding to the actual device happens on the device.</t>
        <t>While EAT does not specify how the signing keys, signature process and storage of the identity values should be secured against attack,
an EAT implementation may have equal defenses against attack.
One reason EAT uses CBOR is because it is simple enough that a basic EAT implementation can be constructed entirely in hardware.
This allows EAT to be implemented with the strongest defenses possible.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="an-x509-format-eat">
        <name>An X.509 Format EAT</name>
        <t>It is possible to define a way to encode EAT claims in an X.509 certificate.
For example, the EAT claims might be mapped to X.509 v3 extensions.
It is even possible to stuff a whole CBOR-encoded unsigned EAT token into a X.509 certificate.</t>
        <t>If that X.509 certificate is an IDevID or LDevID, this becomes another way to use EAT and DevID together.</t>
        <t>Note that the DevID must still be used with an authentication protocol that has a nonce or equivalent.
The EAT here is not being used as the protocol to interact with the rely party.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="device-identifier-permanence">
        <name>Device Identifier Permanence</name>
        <t>In terms of permanence, an IDevID is similar to a UEID in that they do not change over the life of the device.
They cease to exist only when the device is destroyed.</t>
        <t>An SUEID is similar to an LDevID.
They change on device life-cycle events.</t>
        <t><xref target="IEEE.802.1AR"/> describes much of this permanence as resistant to attacks that seek to change the ID.
IDevID permanence can be described this way because <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR"/> is oriented around the definition of an implementation with a particular level of defense against attack.</t>
        <t>EAT is not defined around a particular implementation and must work on a range of devices that have a range of defenses against attack.
EAT thus can't be defined permanence in terms of defense against attack.
EAT's definition of permanence is in terms of operations and device lifecycle.</t>

        <t>It is a broad goal that EATs can be processed by relying parties in a general way regardless of the type, manufacturer or technology of the device from which they originate.
It is a goal that there be general-purpose verification implementations that can verify tokens for large numbers of use cases with special cases and configurations for different device types.
This is a goal of interoperability of the semantics of claims themselves, not just of the signing, encoding and serialization formats.</t>
        <t>This is a lofty goal and difficult to achieve broadly requiring careful definition of claims in a technology neutral way.
Sometimes it will be difficult to design a claim that can represent the semantics of data from very different device types.

They should also be applicable to multiple small embedded operating systems from multiple vendors and everything in between.</t>

        <t>Claims should not be defined such that they are specific to a chip or particular hardware.

Secure Elements and smart cards are examples of this.

        <t>Where possible, claims should use already standardized data items, identifiers and formats.
This takes advantage of the expertise put into creating those formats and improves interoperability.</t>
        <t>Often extant claims will not be defined in an encoding or serialization format used by EAT.
It is preferred to define a CBOR and JSON encoding for them so that EAT implementations do not require a plethora of encoders and decoders for serialization formats.</t>
        <t>In some cases, it may be better to use the encoding and serialization as is.
For example, signed X.509 certificates and CRLs can be carried as-is in a byte string.

      <name>Endorsements and Verification Keys</name>
      <t>The verifier must possess the correct key when it performs the cryptographic part of an EAT verification (e.g., verifying the COSE/JOSE signature).
This section describes several ways to identify the verification key.
There is not one standard method.</t>
      <t>The verification key itself may be a public key, a symmetric key or something complicated in the case of a scheme like Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA).</t>
      <t>RATS Architecture <xref target="RATS.Architecture"/> describes what is called an endorsement.
This is an input to the verifier that is usually the basis of the trust placed in an EAT and the attester that generated it.
It may contain the public key for verification of the signature on the EAT.
It may contain implied claims, those that are passed on to the relying party in attestation results.</t>
      <t>There is not yet any standard format(s) for an endorsement.
One format that may be used for an endorsement is an X.509 certificate.
Endorsement data like reference values and implied claims can be carried in X.509 v3 extensions.
In this use, the public key in the X.509 certificate becomes the verification key, so identification of the endorsement is also identification of the verification key.</t>
      <t>The verification key identification and establishment of trust in the EAT and the attester may also be by some other means than an endorsement.</t>
      <t>For the components (attester, verifier, relying party,...) of a particular end-end attestation system to reliably interoperate, its definition should specify how the verification key is identified.
Usually, this will be in the profile document for a particular attestation system.</t>

          <t>The X.509 certificate may be an endorsement and thus carrying additional input to the verifier. It may be just an X.509 certificate, not an endorsement. The same header parameters are used in both cases. It is up to the attestation system design and the verifier to determine which.</t>

          <name>CBOR Certificate COSE Header Parameters</name>
          <t>Compressed X.509 and CBOR Native certificates are defined by CBOR Certificates <xref target="CBOR.Cert.Draft"/>. These are semantically compatible with X.509 and therefore can be used as an equivalent to X.509 as described above.</t>
          <t>These are identified by their own header parameters (c5t, c5u,...).</t>

          <name>Claim-Based Key Identification</name>
          <t>For some attestation systems, a claim may be re-used as a key identifier. For example, the UEID uniquely identifies the entity and therefore can work well as a key identifier or endorsement identifier.</t>
          <t>This has the advantage that key identification requires no additional bytes in the EAT and makes the EAT smaller.</t>
          <t>This has the disadvantage that the unverified EAT must be substantially decoded to obtain the identifier since the identifier is in the COSE/JOSE payload, not in the headers.</t>
